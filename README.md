# Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software
Coursera Duke University's Class

Week 1 Homework: 

This is my version of the Week 1 Homework Assignment from the Coursera Duke University calss named "Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software". 

This code fixes the bugs I found in other Git repos posted by other students for the same assignment. Some common bugs I noticed are code whereby the getFileWithLargestPerimeter() returns the wrong output 
or 
the way in which the FileResource class is used doesn't allow for 6 or more files to be selected when the pop-up window appears in BlueJ IDE. 

Note that to select multiple files, you have to select the first one only first (example: getdata1.txt), and then when the pop-up window appears again, you can actually select all the files you need (example: getdata1.txt, getdata2.txt, .... , getdata6.txt).


Week 2 Exercise Part1:

This is my version of the Programming Exercise: Finding a Gene and Web Links.
